# KPIs and Experimentation in Data Engineering

This repository delves into the pivotal role of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and experimentation within data engineering. It offers strategies, best practices, and tools for defining, tracking, and optimizing KPIs in data pipelines and experimentation workflows.

---

## Overview

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable measures that help organizations assess progress toward strategic goals. In data engineering, KPIs provide insights into pipeline performance, system reliability, and the impact of data-driven experiments. This repository includes:

- Methods for defining meaningful KPIs.
- Examples of experiments and A/B testing in data engineering.
- Best practices for ensuring data integrity and accuracy in experimentation.

---

## Why KPIs Matter in Data Engineering

- **Performance Monitoring:** Track the efficiency and reliability of data pipelines.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate how data changes influence business metrics.
- **Optimization:** Identify bottlenecks and enhance pipeline performance.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Latency:** Measure the time taken for data to traverse pipelines.
- **Throughput:** Assess the volume of data processed within a specific timeframe.
- **Error Rate:** Monitor the frequency of failed processes or invalid data entries.
- **Data Freshness:** Ensure data availability aligns with business requirements.

### 2. Experimentation in Data Pipelines

- **A/B Testing:** Compare two pipeline configurations to evaluate performance improvements.
- **Feature Flagging:** Gradually roll out changes to minimize risk.
- **Observability:** Utilize monitoring tools to capture real-time metrics during experiments.

### 3. Tools and Frameworks

- **Apache Airflow:** For orchestrating and tracking pipeline workflows.
- **Datadog:** For real-time monitoring of pipeline KPIs.
- **Great Expectations:** For validating data quality during experimentation.

## Best Practices

### Defining KPIs

- Align KPIs with business objectives.
- Ensure KPIs are simple, measurable, and actionable.
- Regularly review and refine KPIs to maintain relevance.

### Experimentation Workflow

1. **Hypothesis Formation:** Define a clear hypothesis to test.
2. **Baseline Measurement:** Record initial KPI values for comparison.
3. **Controlled Rollout:** Test changes on a subset of data or pipelines.
4. **Evaluation:** Analyze metrics to validate the impact of the experiment.

### Ensuring Data Integrity

- Implement checksums and hashing to validate data accuracy.
- Automate anomaly detection in pipeline metrics.
- Establish logging and monitoring at each stage of the pipeline.

## Example: A/B Testing in Data Engineering

![A/B Testing Workflow](https://datatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ab-testing.png)

**Hypothesis:** Switching from JSON to Parquet format improves pipeline throughput.

1. Create two pipeline configurations (A = JSON, B = Parquet).
2. Distribute incoming data equally between the two configurations.
3. Measure and compare throughput, latency, and error rate KPIs.
4. Implement the configuration with superior performance metrics.
