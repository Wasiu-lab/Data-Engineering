### Introduction to Fact Data Modeling and How It Differs from Dimensional Data Modeling

Fact data modeling and dimensional data modeling are critical techniques in the world of data analytics, each with unique purposes and structures tailored to different aspects of a database.

#### **What is Fact Data Modeling?**
Fact data modeling focuses on storing and analyzing quantitative metrics (facts) related to business processes. Examples include sales revenue, player statistics, or website traffic. These facts are usually numeric and are often aggregated for reporting purposes (e.g., total sales, average scores).

### **Fact Data Modeling vs. Dimensional Data Modeling**

| Feature                | Fact Data Modeling                          | Dimensional Data Modeling                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Focuses on quantitative measures (facts).  | Combines facts and dimensions for analysis. |
| **Core Components**    | Fact tables only.                          | Fact and dimension tables.               |
| **Complexity**         | Less intuitive for non-technical users.    | Designed for ease of understanding.      |
| **Data Relationships** | More normalized.                           | Often denormalized for performance.      |
| **Usage**              | Best for heavy analytics and aggregation.  | Ideal for business intelligence and reporting. |

Dimensional modeling is broader and incorporates both facts and dimensions, making it a more intuitive approach for designing data warehouses. Fact modeling focuses exclusively on capturing measurable data for computational purposes.

### **Understanding Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**

**What is SCD?**  
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) are techniques used to manage the historical evolution of dimension data. When attributes of a dimension, like a player's team or a customer’s address, change over time, SCD ensures the database captures these changes without losing historical context.

---

### **Types of SCD and Their Usage**

1. **Type 1 (Overwrite):**  
   The simplest form, where old data is overwritten with new data.  
   **When to Use:**  
   - When historical accuracy isn’t critical.  
   - Example: Correcting a spelling mistake.

2. **Type 2 (Versioning):**  
   Creates a new row for each change, preserving history.  
   **When to Use:**  
   - When tracking historical changes is essential.  
   - Example: Player moving to a new team while keeping past team affiliations.

3. **Type 3 (Adding a Column):**  
   Adds a column for the most recent change, limited to tracking one change.  
   **When to Use:**  
   - When only the current and previous states are required.  
   - Example: Keeping track of a promotion.

---

### **When to Use SCD**

Use SCD when you need to:
- Maintain historical accuracy of changes over time.
- Analyze trends or the impact of attribute changes on business metrics.
- Implement systems where data lineage and traceability are critical (e.g., customer relationship management or sports analytics).
To proceed with the analysis, I'll focus on summarizing the purpose and structure of the files based on what they likely contain, then include them in the README draft. Let's revisit the project step by step, combining the provided files with the context of dimensional modeling.

### Steps for the GitHub README:

1. **Introduce Dimensional Data Modeling**  
   Explain the concept and its applications briefly.

2. **Purpose of Each SQL File**  
   Detail the role and objectives of each query:
   - **Array Metrics (Lab 3)**: Likely involves using arrays for handling metrics or advanced calculations.
   - **Cumulative Table (Get Date List)**: Aims to retrieve cumulative results based on user-specified dates.
   - **Date List Initialization**: Handles operations related to creating or using a date list.
   - **Fact Modeling Table**: Focuses on defining a fact table and implementing fact modeling concepts.

3. **Practical Implementation**  
   Provide explanations for the queries and instructions for execution.

4. **Repository Usage Guide**  
   Show how to set up and use the repository for educational purposes.

I’ll begin drafting the README using this structure.

### README Draft: Dimensional Data Modeling with SQL

# Dimensional Data Modeling with SQL

Dimensional data modeling is a cornerstone of data analytics, providing a structured approach to organize data for querying and reporting. This repository demonstrates practical SQL implementations of dimensional data modeling techniques, including fact modeling, cumulative calculations, and advanced date-based operations.

## Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling

Dimensional modeling structures data into **fact tables** and **dimension tables**, making it easier to analyze business processes. It prioritizes ease of querying and supports decision-making processes.  

### Key Concepts:
- **Fact Tables**: Store measurable data, such as sales, revenue, or player performance metrics.
- **Dimension Tables**: Provide context to the facts, such as dates, products, or players.

### Why Dimensional Data Modeling?  
- Simplifies complex analytical queries.  
- Optimized for performance in large-scale reporting systems.  
- Intuitive structure for business users and analysts.
