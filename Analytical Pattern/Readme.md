# Data Engineering Analytic Patterns

Welcome to the **Data Engineering Analytic Patterns** repository! This folder introduces key patterns that simplify pipeline design and enhance data model development. These reusable strategies save time and improve efficiency, scalability, and reliability in data solutions.

## Why Analytic Patterns Matter

Analytic patterns address recurring challenges in data engineering. They provide:

- Simplified pipeline design.
- Consistent, accurate data transformations.
- Optimized performance for large datasets.
- Deeper, actionable insights.

By using these patterns, you create scalable, maintainable solutions that adapt to evolving business needs.

## Key Analytic Patterns

### 1. Funnels

Funnels track sequential steps in processes like user onboarding or purchases. They reveal bottlenecks and optimize workflows.

**Use Cases:**
- Monitoring e-commerce conversion rates.
- Analyzing task completion rates.
- Identifying workflow inefficiencies.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT step, COUNT(*) AS users
FROM user_journey
GROUP BY step
ORDER BY step;
```

**Insights:**
- Drop-off points in processes.
- Stage efficiency and success rates.
- Opportunities for improvement.

### 2. Window Functions

Window functions calculate values across related rows without losing data granularity. These include:

- **Ranking:** `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`.
- **Aggregation:** `SUM()`, `AVG()`.
- **Offsets:** `LEAD()`, `LAG()`.

**Use Cases:**
- Running totals or moving averages.
- Ranking items within categories.
- Comparing values across time.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, purchase_date, SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY purchase_date) AS running_total
FROM purchases;
```

Window functions enable precise insights through partitioned data calculations.

### 3. Grouping Techniques

Grouping patterns aggregate data for detailed and high-level insights.

#### a. **Grouping Sets**
Multiple groupings in one query for flexibility.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((region), (product));
```

#### b. **CUBE**
All combinations of dimensions for multidimensional views.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY CUBE (region, product);
```

#### c. **ROLLUP**
Hierarchical aggregations for subtotals and totals.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ROLLUP (region, product);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Sales and performance reports.
- Multidimensional summaries.
- Hierarchical dataset analysis.

### 4. Self-Joins

Self-joins compare rows within the same table, useful for:

- Exploring hierarchical relationships.
- Tracking time-series trends.
- Detecting duplicates or grouping data.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT a.transaction_id, a.user_id, b.transaction_id AS next_transaction
FROM transactions a
JOIN transactions b
  ON a.user_id = b.user_id AND a.transaction_date < b.transaction_date;
```

### 5. Cross Join and UNNEST

#### a. **Cross Join**
Generates Cartesian products, combining all rows from two tables.

**Use Cases:**
- Exploring product feature combinations.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
CROSS JOIN features;
```

#### b. **UNNEST**
Expands arrays or nested structures into rows for analysis.

**Use Cases:**
- Flattening JSON fields.
- Analyzing multi-valued attributes.
- Simplifying complex data.

**Syntax Example:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, unnest(interests) AS interest
FROM user_data;
